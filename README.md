# HydroSense Monitor

To unlock the full potential of crops, providing the best growing conditions is important.
This is a demo app created in honor of Agwa company. It monitors a growing cabin by sending pH, temperature, and conductivity readings every ten minutes. Acting like a simple virtual agronomist, it helps track the health and nutrition needs of crops to support their growth.

Inspired by Jewish philosophy to make the world a better place, the aim is to improve the lives of people who lack access to fresh crops because they work in remote and isolated places like rigs and vessels.
